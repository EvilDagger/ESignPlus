# eSign for TrollStore: Great Unofficial App Store for TrollStore

eSign+ (or eSignPlus) is a modified version of eSign that allows and supports the installation of IPA files on TrollStore instead of using certificates. This is an TrollApps alternative for users which prefer the eSign interface more or want to switch for any particular reason. This is not an official or approved app store of TrollStore (opa334 has disapproved of official app stores for TrollStore due to piracy concerns). 

Before starting the entirety of this block of text, keep in mind that the eSign+ persistence app can be called the eSign+ helper app. These are not exact since these have slightly different purposes but the outcome is the same, really.
## Everything about eSign+

### Is this your work?

No. Here's the truth and history of eSign+: This was uploaded by an more obscure source and it generally was hard-to-find. A few Reddit threads were about this tool which barely anybody had found and only one YouTube video of it by TechJunkie Aman. TechJunkie Aman had been using the same source as everybody else, the same broken and non-working source as of today. One day, while following that tutorial... the source didn't work and I couldn't get the files! **I LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR THE FILES... EVERY ARCHIVE... EVERY CLUE... EVERY FOOTPRINT... I found it on some random web server archive which served the files (the web server is defunct as of today)**. That's how I got the tarred version of eSign+ which works as of today (assuming the TechJunkie Aman or other official tutorials that may have been released have worked) and was able to untar it, modify it and generally spread and use it.

However, it's not just a case of "total theft". The program itself has been barely rewritten from original eSign (UI elements, license etc. etc.) except the functionality. In the other hand, without my intensive search, eSign+ would remain unfound. Without my dedication to the repository, extras and other things coming out (eSign++ is coming!), this would remain a myth on the shadow. 

### Does this have bugs?

This is the truly unmodified version (tarred and untarred) eSign+. This doesn't include the possible bugs of eSign++ or any modified eSign+ (which in turn isn't eSign+) version. The bugs are:

1. Helper Application Bug (Tested): The original helper app works as expected when setting it up however when making a new helper app (particularly after removing the helper app) with any system binary/app. The new helper binary/app **doesn't work** and upon opening, it automatically closes. It may happen or may not happen for you.
2. Small TrollBug (lolololol): This is a small bug. Firstly, the application will not show up in TrollStore which makes uninstallation slightly harder. When uninstalling the app, you need to go to eSign+, Settings and click the red Uninstall button and choose the best option for your needs. After that, refresh the icon cache on TrollStore, **not your jailbreak**. If the app doesn't go away after that, refer to the "**How to Uninstall eSign+?**" section.

Those are all the currently found bugs. For unfound/new bugs, please report it as a GitHub issue (keep in mind: I'm not a expert on iOS coding, somebody either needs to pull request or this bug needs to be very well documented: possibly going down deep to the precise file causing the issue). If your issue was reported but hasn't got fixed, if it's a big issue, bump it (respond to it with not "bump" but a simple message about it to bring it on top of the issues) or if it's a small issue, wait for it to eventually get attention.

### How to Uninstall eSign+?

99.999% of the time, eSign+ will be gone after simply uninstalling it via the app and refreshing the TrollStore icon cache. If it's not uninstalled or you simply want to get all traces of eSign+ off your device, it's quite easy to do both in these moves:

1. Uninstall the application in the eSign+ settings
2. If you have Filza (assuming you have not installed eSign+ from other sources, installed it from TechJunkie Aman's tutorial or simply from Filza), open it and check the path of where you installed the app at, the helper app at (rewind possible followed tutorials or steps). When found, remove the entire app (not including helper binary)
3. (Optional) Go to the helper app and uninstall it
4. (Optional but recommended) Perform system cleaning in iClean (or iClean Pro) to clean off the app 
5. Go to the Files app (or Filza), find the eSign+ folder/ZIP and uninstall it. This ensures that the pre-install traces of the app get removed.
6. Refresh the TrollStore icon cache
7. If this issue still isn't fixed, do all the optional steps if undone. Lastly, refresh your jailbreak's icon cache. If the app is still there, restart your phone.

### Does this tool require jailbreak?

That depends on the way you are setting eSign+ up! The traditional way to setup eSign+ (refer to "**Setting up eSign+**") requires a rootful jailbreak. The other ways of setting this program up don't require any jailbreaking or are easier to do. If you don't have jailbreak privileges, use the other methods of setting eSign+ up.

The traditional method of setting eSign+ up requires a jailbreak of the rootful environment since apart from the convenience reasons (installing apps that are typically only installed and found in their true power at jailbroken environments), the modification of system files and directories, change of group and user ownership and permission changes all require jailbreaking and a rootful one, that is!

### What version of eSign is this tool?

It's the eSign 5.0.0 version under the hood. That's not the newest version but it's not old at all!

### Can this tool do regular signing?

The main purpose of eSign+ is to provide an app store for TrollStore that's really eSign! It can do regular signing with certificates. If you're exclusively using eSign+ for certificate signing, kindly uninstall it since that doesn't fit with the purpose or setup methods of this tool and install eSign's latest version or start using the "Troll Install". **eSign+ can do anything eSign can, however it includes TrollStore support too! It's *not* a totally different app!** Talking about regular signing, you can install eSign+ for the sole purpose of non-TrollStore signing with it's IPA. Another reason to not use eSign+ for signing only is the fact that it's not the latest version of eSign (eSign will have a mildly different experience).
